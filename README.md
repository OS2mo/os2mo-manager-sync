## SD MANAGER SYNC
This repository contains the OS2mo manager script for updating managers in MO.

### Overview
Managers are updated based on data imported from SD-Løn _prior_ to running this integration, i.e.
the code does not make any calls to SD while running, but instead only updates managers
based on the data already found in MO.

The code has the following responsibilities:

1. Create any missing manager level classes in MO based on configurations provided by
   environment variables.
2. Terminate managers with no active engagement in the org unit where they are set
   as manager.
3. Assign new managers to org units based on info in special child org units
   with name ending in "_leder".

### Detailed Description
This section describes how the code logic operates when the application is triggered.

1. All current manager roles are checked to verify the employee has an active engagement in the organisation unit
   they are placed. If not: manager role get terminated (manager roles end date set to today).
2. For every organisation unit (org-unit) with `name` ending in `_leder` and name NOT prepended with `Ø_`:
   ![_leder org-unit](readme_images/_leder.png  "_leder org-unit")
   1. Get all employees with association to `_leder` unit.
      ![Tilknytninger](readme_images/tilknytning.png  "Tilknytninger")</p>
   2. Check each employee has an active engagement in parent org-unit. If more than
      one employee with association in `_leder` org-unit, check which employee has
      the latest `engagement from` date. The one with latest engagement date becomes
      manager in parent org-unit.
   3. The manger roles `manager_level` is based on the org-unit level in which
      the manager role is assigned:
      ![Manager level](readme_images/manager_level.png)
   4. If the parent org-unit name ends with `led-adm`, the manager will also become
      manager of this org-unit's parent org-unit (Notice: Manager level is based
      on org-unit level from the highest ranking org-unit).
      ![led-adm](readme_images/_led-adm.png)
      In the above illustration, manager fetched from `_leder` unit becomes manager
      in not only "Byudvikling" but also "Borgmesterens Afdeling" as "Byudvikling is
      marked as an `led-adm` unit. Manager level is then based on org-unit level
      from "Borgmesterens Afdeling".
   5. Once a manager has been selected based on above criteria, associations for all
      other employees in `_leder` unit are terminated. Leaving just one association
      in `_leder` unit.


## Configuration

The follow environment variables can be used to configure the application:

TODO: some of the settings can possibly be retrieved from MO automatically
instead of being set via the environment...

* `MO_URL`:  Base URL for MO
* `CLIENT_ID`:  Keycloak client ID
* `CLIENT_SECRET`: Keycloak client secret corresponding to the Keycloak client
* `ROOT_UUID`: UUID of the root organisation unit. Instance dependant.
* `MANAGER_TYPE_UUID`: Default UUID for `Manager type`. Instance dependant.
* `RESPONSIBILITY_UUID`: Default UUID for `Manager type`. Instance dependant.
* `MANAGER_LEVEL_MAPPING`: Dict with `org-unit level UUID` classes as keys and `manager level UUID` as values. Used to map from `org_unit_level` to `manager_level`.


## Usage

To start the container using `docker-compose`:
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

After the container is up and running, the script can be run manually by
triggering a `FastAPI` endpoint:

 * By using the GUI at:<br>
```http://localhost:8000/docs```
and triggering `/trigger/all`.
 * Calling the endpoint from terminal: <br>
```$ curl -X 'POST' 'http://localhost:8000/trigger/all'``` <br>

As it checks and updates managers you will get a lot of output in `docker logs`,
especially if you have opted for `debug` information from logs.

Once the script has finished the last lines will look like this:

```
sd_managerscript_1  | 2022-12-09 10:38.30 [info     ] Filter Managers
sd_managerscript_1  | 2022-12-09 10:38.30 [info     ] Updating Managers
sd_managerscript_1  | 2022-12-09 10:38.30 [info     ] Updating managers complete!

```

## Development
***
### Prerequisites

- [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@git.magenta.dk:rammearkitektur/os2mo-manager-sync.git
```

2. Install all dependencies:
```
poetry install
```

3. Set up pre-commit:
```
poetry run pre-commit install
```

### Running the tests

You use `poetry` and `pytest` to run the tests:

`poetry run pytest`

You can also run specific files

`poetry run pytest tests/<test_folder>/<test_file.py>`

and even use filtering with `-k`

`poetry run pytest -k "Manager"`

You can use the flags `-vx` where `v` prints the test & `x` makes the test stop if any tests fails (Verbose, X-fail)

### Injecting test data into OS2MO
Test data have been prepared for local development. Using the test data requires
a running OS2mo instance locally as well as the standard test data from Kolding,
which is included in OS2mo repository.

Before using this integration locally you need to clone and run the `OS2MO` container from [OS2MO repo](https://git.magenta.dk/rammearkitektur/os2mo):
Once cloned you can start main `OS2MO` container using:
```docker-compose up --build -d```

You can now inject test data from this repository by changing folder to where this repository is located locally.
Then run the following command:

```
poetry run python tests/test_data/inject_test_data.py "603f1c82-d012-4d04-9382-dbe659c533fb"
```
UUID passed as an parameter is required password

### Development info

Sending and fetching data to/from `OS2MO` is done using a `GraphQL` client imported from `Ra-clients` [repos here](https://git.magenta.dk/rammearkitektur/ra-clients)

***

## TODO
* Leder units have to be NY-levels - currently failing for Afdelings-niveauer
* If there is no active engagement in OU and employee currently is manager
  the manager will be terminated per todays date (and not when the engagement ended)
